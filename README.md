## Description

This program evolved from its first CLI version written in C for Windows.
It integrates the Generator, Trainer and Editor of sheets/characters, Skill manager and Battle manager into a single system.
This is an application built in Netbeans IDE using Java Language with PostgreSQL for the database.
The architecture has no standard, because it is a system written by an amateur developer who would later become a professional, he did not yet know the SOLID principles, design patterns or even the Client-Server Pattern.
However, this project carries a large part of my passion for development and RPG, being the main reason I became a software developer.
And, therefore, I am creating a web application as gratitude to this project that guided my professional life, but also to leave this software/system free (and open software) for RPG and Hunter X Hunter lovers!
